A reddit firehose
## What?
Take a sip from the fountain of high-quality, algorithm-free content reddit has to offer in near real-time.

Provided as a single file for self-hosting or opening locally in a web browser.

~This may break on [June 19th, 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_ap) so enjoy while it lasts.~

This still works even after all that drama.

## How?
The page pulls the most recent post ID from Reddit then loads all content posted since. Additional posts will load as fast as you can scroll.
## Why?
Inspired by [redditp](https://redditp.com), but for new content not whatever's popular.
